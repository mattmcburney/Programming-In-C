/* Traditionally the first program people write in a new language is called “Hello, World.” because all it does is print the words “Hello, World.” In C++, this program looks like this: */

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// main: generate some simple output
int main () {
    cout << "Hello, World." << endl;
    return 0;
}

/*This program prints two different statements on two different lines using endl. */

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// main: generate some simple output
int main () {
    cout << "Hello, world." << endl;     // output one line
    cout << "How are you?" << endl;      // output another
}

/*This program prints two different statements on the same line.*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
    cout << "Goodbye, ";
    cout << "cruel world!" << endl;
}

/*This program accomplishes the same thing as the one above. The difference is that there are no spaces separating the different components of each line. This is a matter of personal preference.*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
    cout<<"Goodbye, ";
    cout<<"cruel world!"<<endl;
}
